Javascript Quiz with a Timer
This app aims to provide a short quiz about the basics of javascript, with a timer which deducts time for incorrect answers.
It doesn't succeed in all of those ambitions.
ISSUES
Although successful in the implementation of some features, such as randomised questions and a colourful background colour-change to indicate correct or incorrect answers, unfortunately, it has some shortfalls. It doesn't track and save the user's score, as I would have liked and it doesn't have an active timer. Yet.
NEXT STEPS
I'm going to persevere with the this project until I can get it to work the way I want it to. And then I'll repost.
